# human-action-recognition
This project implements a full pipeline for action recognition. It processes video files, extracts Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features from frames, builds a vocabulary using K-Means clustering (Bag of Visual Words), and trains a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify actions.
